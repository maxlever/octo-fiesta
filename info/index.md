# Briefing

We’re working on an interactive painting artboard similar to MS Paint, however it will not quite act in the same manner as the original. The purpose of today’s session is for you to help us figure out how to make this interface more understandable before we finish developing it. We have created a web-based prototype of the screens and are going to give you some tasks that we think are representative of what people might do in real life. The prototype still has some rough edges and is incomplete. Before we cast it in concrete, we want to get feedback about how well this design works. Let us know what makes sense, what’s confusing, whether it works the way you’d expect it to, etc.  If you run into any problems it’s not your fault and it means that there’s something we need to change. Remember that we’re testing the interface—we’re not testing you.
