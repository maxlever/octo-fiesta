HCI - Project Assignment #1

Jillian, Max, Miranda

1. _**Problem**. Describe the problem you chose and how the system will help users._

People take the systems they use for granted, interpret user interfaces as immutable and as good as they can be instead of a series of design choices and conventions.

2. _**Target users**. Characterize the user population._

Artists or people who are in the intersection of art and technology.

3. _**Solution**. Describe a possible solution to the problem --- i.e., the interface that you envision, and how it will address the problem. You aren't absolutely committed to your solution, since you may find after building and evaluating some prototypes that a wholly different solution will work better._

A web-based art piece which masquerades as a conventional website or application but over time degrades in such a way that interacting with it does not produce the results the user expects:  

An online paint program comparable to MS Paint that contradicts design heuristics such as Nielsenâ€™s in order to get the user to notice and appreciate factors in user interfaces that we take for granted. Some ideas for the interface:
- Start off looking exactly like MS Paint and as the user interacts with it more, things slowly change and start to look slightly different.
- Expected paint program abilities (i.e. drawing, selection, smudging, etc)
- Pen runs out ink
- Appears to be glitchy
- Interface changes unexpectedly

4. _**Success**.  What is success to you guys?  How do you measure it?  I want you thinking long and hard about how you evaluate this system and what you expect to see._

Success is: 
- Users remaining on the website for the duration of the piece (i.e. until the interface has fully degraded)
- Users explore most of the onscreen elements
- Users provide feedback indicating an emotional response to the changing interface

Measure success with a survey or interview asking for feedback
- How they think
- What did they learn from this
- What does this mean
- Ask general knowledge of interfaces
- What did they like/dislike
- What did they find easy/frustrating
